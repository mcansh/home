# wiz_light
A Home assistant integration for (Phillips, SLV and more) WiZ Light bulbs

Tested with the following smart lights:

* [Original Phillips Wiz WiFi LEDs](https://www.lighting.philips.co.in/consumer/smart-wifi-led)
* [SLV Play RGB bulb](https://www.amazon.de/dp/B07PNCDJLW)
* [WiZ Filament Bulb](https://www.wizconnected.com/en/consumer/products/g95-filament-whites/)

## Kudos and contributions
Thank you [@angadsingh](https://github.com/angadsingh) for make such incredible improvements!!

Bug fixes:
 - Fixes https://github.com/sbidy/wiz_light/issues/6: make the whole component truly async using non-blocking UDP
 - Light control now works even when lights are set to a rhythm.

Features:
 - Supports switching the light to rhythm mode! (rhythm is defined as a scene for HA)
 - Implements a pattern of sending multiple command UDP datagrams until response is received
 - Consolidates getPilot and setPilot calls using a PilotBuilder and PilotParser. Removes unnecessary UDP calls for each and every attribute (color, temperature, brightness, scene, etc.) and makes a combined getPilot/setPilot call
 - enhanced debug logging for UDP

This component does need a dependency on `pywizlight` like @sbidy's component which will be install automatically by Home Assistant.

Please report as issue your builb type with a feature list:

`echo '{"method":"getSystemConfig","params":{}}' | nc -u -w 1 <YOU BULB IP> 38899`

## Working features 
 - Brightness
 - Color (RGB)
 - White Color Temperature
 - On/Off, Toggle
 - Effects
 - Setting a rhythm as a scene

## Next improvement:
- testing with other hardware -- **Contribution required !!**
- Config Flow Support

## Pull request in HA core
https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/35132

## Install for testing 

1. Loggon to your HA or HASS with SSH
2. Got to the HA `custom_components` directory within the HA installation path (if this is not available - create this directory).
3. Run `cd custom_components`
4. Run `git clone https://github.com/sbidy/wiz_light` within the `custom_components` directory
5. Run `mv wiz_light/custom_components/wiz_light/* wiz_light/` to move the files in the correct diretory
6. Restart your HA/HASS service in the UI with `<your-URL>/config/server_control`
7. Add the bulbs to your `configuration.yaml` - You can not add the bulbs in the HA UI!! (configFlow is missing)

As an alternativ you can use the HACS platform for installation - see [HACS Website](https://hacs.xyz)

Questions? Check out the github project [pywizlight](https://github.com/sbidy/pywizlight)

## Testing
See `test.py` for how the underlying API works

## HA config
To enable the platform integration after installation add 
```
light:
  - platform: wiz_light
    name: <Name of the device>
    host: <IP of the bulb>
  - platform: wiz_light
    name: <Name of the device#2>
    host: <IP of the bulb#2>
```
